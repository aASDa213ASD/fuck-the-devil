## fuck-the-devil
Devil Daggers trainer for 3.2 version.

### Usage
* Start the game, head to trainer
* Start: ```fuckTheDevil.exe```
* Use the following keys:
   * `F9`: Show debug menu
   * `SHIFT + Z`: Reload offsets if your process has other name 'devildaggers.exe' for instance ('dd' by default);
   * `F1`: Set gem value to 0
   * `F2`: Set gem value to 20
   * `F3`: Set gem value to 70
   * `F4`: Set gem value to 101
   * `F5`: Make yourself "dead". It just pauses the game, stops monsters from spawn, makes yourself invulnerable, you just can't die if you already dead.
   As well F5 doesn't reset the game, so now it's only just a pause.
